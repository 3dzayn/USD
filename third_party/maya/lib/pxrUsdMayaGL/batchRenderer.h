/// UsdMayaGLBatchRenderer is a singleton that shapes can use to get consistent
/// batched drawing via Hydra in Maya, regardless of legacy viewport or
/// Viewport 2.0 usage.
///
/// Typical usage is as follows:
///
/// Objects that manage drawing and selection of Maya shapes (e.g. classes
/// derived from \c MPxSurfaceShapeUI or \c MPxDrawOverride) should construct
/// and maintain a PxrMayaHdShapeAdapter. Those objects should call
/// AddShapeAdapter() to add their shape for batched drawing and selection. The
/// batch renderer will pass along its \c HdRenderIndex to the shape adapter to
/// initialize it if the shape adapter had not previously been added.
///
/// At every refresh, in the prepare for draw stage, the shape adapter should
/// be populated with Maya scene graph and viewport display data. It should
/// then be passed along to QueueShapeForDraw() for every batch draw pass
/// desired.
///
/// In the draw stage, Draw() must be called for each draw request to complete
/// the render.
///
/// Draw/selection management objects should be sure to call
/// RemoveShapeAdapter() (usually in the destructor) when they no longer wish
/// for their shape to participate in batched drawing and selection.
