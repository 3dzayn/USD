 * \ingroup group_tf_SystemsExt
 *
 * This is a wrapper around ArchOpenLibrary(), in the sense that this function
 * simply calls ArchOpenLibrary(\p name, \p flag).  It will additionally load
 * script bindings if scripting is initialized and loading is requested.
 * 
 * If \p error is not NULL, it will be set to the return value of
 * a ArchLibraryError() call after the dlopen(), or cleared if that value is NULL.
 * It is not reliable to get the error string by calling ArchLibraryError()
 * after \c TfDlopen().
 *
 * If you set the environment variable TF_DLOPEN_DEBUG then debug output
 * will be sent to stdout on each invocation of this function.
