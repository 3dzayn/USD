Subject: [usdMaya] make UsdMayaTranslatorUtil::CreateShaderNode use shadingNode

The docs said it was intended to mimic this command, but it was lacking some
functionality; in theory, we might have been able to add the (known) missing
functionality, but past experience has shown attempting to replicate this
command not worth the small efficiency gain by avoiding the string conversions
needed by mel commands.

Also eliminated ConnectDefaultLightNode, since it was also mimicing this command
