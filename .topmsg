Subject: [usdMaya] fix for VP2 selection when MAYA_VP2_USE_VP1_SELECTION is off

Currently, if using "pure" VP2 selection (ie, MAYA_VP2_USE_VP1_SELECTION is not
set), then if the "softSelectable" attribute is off, the object cannot be
selected by clicking on it in the viewport.

This is because proxyShape attempts to control soft-selection via
MPxSurfaceShape::getShapeSelectionMask().  Unfortunately, the intent of this
function is to control which selection filters the shape responds to, for any
selection (ie, normal + soft selection), and it is only a quirk / bug of
MAYA_VP2_USE_VP1_SELECTION mode that this setting is queried for soft selection,
but not normal selection.

To make the softSelectable attr work in both pure VP2 and
MAYA_VP2_USE_VP1_SELECTION modes, we now check if object-mode soft-selection is
currently on, and if the object is set to be not selectable; if so, we return
an empty mask, disabling selection.
